> **Never make a calculation until you know the answer.** 
> Make an estimate before every calculation, 
> try a simple physical argument (symmetry! invariance! conservation!) 
> before every derivation, guess the answer to every paradox and puzzle. 
> Courage: No one else needs to know what the guess is. Therefore make it quickly, by instinct. 
> A right guess reinforces this instinct. A wrong guess brings the refreshment of surprise. 
> In either case life as a spacetime expert, however long, is more fun!

John Archibald Wheeler
